# CS330 MATLAB Programming Languages Project

### History
MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory) did not start as a programming language, instead it began as an interactive matrix calculator written in Fortran. Created by Cleve Moler 
in the 70's, the original MATLAB was a simple software involving just 71 functions, which he used to teach his math students at the University of New Mexico. In 1983, a graduate 
student named Jack Little proposed a commercial version of MATLAB, which he went on to write in C. In the modern day, MATLAB uses its own language, and is one of the most-used 
pieces of engineering software.

### Getting started
In order to download MATLAB, you will need to [create a MathWorks account](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/account/create%3Furi%3D&ved=2ahUKEwjfvIi309mPAxXK1fACHV4GDKwQFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3r5vfrzF05FJcWfugFbP36)
from there you can download a version of MATLAB compatible with your device, or access [MATLAB online](https://matlab.mathworks.com). If you are downloading the software to your device
you will need to make note of which kind of chip you have in order to download the correct version. The MATLAB language can only be used in its own programming environment.

> [!NOTE]
> MATLAB is not a free software, and in order to use it you may need to purchase access. If you are a student, it is possible your school pays for campus-wide access.

### Tips and tricks
* Comments are made by putting the percent symbol (%) before a line of code.
* All data types are matrices, even single values.
* Indexing starts with 1, not 0.
