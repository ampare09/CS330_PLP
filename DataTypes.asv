% If you do not declare a variable name, MATLAB stores your answer as 'ans'
12+20
% By default, numbers in MATLAB are stored as doubles
x = 5
xType = class(x)
% MATLAB allows you to declare how much storage you want an integer to take
% You can specify the storage size using the 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', or 'int64' types
tinyInt = int8(5)
biggerInt = int32(1000)
% Be careful because declaring a smaller type than you need will store the
% maximum value of that type
testerInt = int16(1234567)
